  						The Flutter Travel App is designed for travelers.

On th home page we have `Top Destinations` and `Exclusive Hotels` carousels. Clicking on any destination will take you to the second page of destinations where we can find excursion suggestions. Both the top and bottom navigation bars are active to change the state, but so far they are leading nowhere.
